# Kindle Zotero Importer

Import Kindle `My Clippings.txt` highlights into Zotero as native annotations; directly inside Zotero, no terminal needed.

## Install (30 seconds)

1. Download `kindle-zotero-importer.xpi` from [Releases](../../releases) (latest `0.6.4`, or `0.6.4-beta` for preview).
2. In Zotero: `Tools → Plugins → gear → Install Plugin From File…` → pick the `.xpi` → restart Zotero.
3. `Tools → Kindle Zotero Importer…` to open the manager.

Works with Zotero 7–10; macOS/Windows/Linux; PDF and EPUB.

## Use

1. **Choose your file**; click `Choose My Clippings.txt` and pick your *cumulative* `My Clippings.txt` from Kindle (`/Documents/My Clippings.txt`); keep the window open; you will see live progress.
2. **Check Integrated**; after the run, `Integrated` shows what was imported (`Highlight Text`; `Citekey`; `Added On`; `Integrated`; `Page`); filter to find anything.
3. **Fix Conflicts**; if a Kindle title did not match a Zotero item, `Conflicts` shows it with up to 3 suggestions `citekey · title (score%)`; click `Use` on the right one; or type any `citation key` / `Zotero key` / `Item ID` under `Use Custom`; or `Ignore Title` to skip it forever; if you map `chabot2013` for one `Simondon` variant, it will offer to apply the same mapping to the other variants with that candidate.
4. **Re-import**; after you have fixed one or more titles, click `↻ Re-import with saved overrides` (re-uses the last file; or asks for it); only new/changed highlights are re-positioned; already integrated ones are skipped, so the second run is fast; check `Full re-import from scratch` only if you want to rebuild everything.
5. **Mappings**; see all titles you have approved or ignored, newest first, with date; `Delete` any entry to send it back to `Conflicts` for re-matching.
6. **Settings / Artifacts**; change `Python`/`Zotero DB` paths and `Save Settings`; or `Open`/`Reveal` any generated file (`mismatch-review.md`; `match-overrides.json`; …).

Your choices are saved in `match-overrides.json` in the project folder; back it up, share it, or delete an entry to undo a mapping.

## Tips

- Keep `My Clippings.txt` cumulative (do not clear it on the Kindle); the importer remembers what is already integrated via `kindle-id:<hash>` tags, so re-imports are incremental.
- If a highlight is positioned in the wrong place, check that the Zotero item has the correct PDF/EPUB attached (not a link); `Matched-title-no-attachment` in `Conflicts` means that.
- `Full re-import` is only needed if you changed many mappings at once or want to rebuild from scratch.

## For developers / CLI

```sh
python scripts/build_plugin.py  # → dist/kindle-zotero-importer.xpi
python -m kindle_zotero_importer run "/path/to/My Clippings.txt" --workdir . --pretty
python -m kindle_zotero_importer run ... --full  # ignore incremental; re-process all
```

PDF positioning uses Poppler (`pdftotext`; `pdftohtml`; `pdfinfo`) + `qpdf` fallback; EPUB uses CFI. Zotero writes are only via `Zotero.Annotations`; never direct `zotero.sqlite` writes.

Anonymized sharing is **on by default** to help future development (only `citation key`; hashed highlight; `color`; `has comment` + note; `added_on`; `integrated_at`; never raw highlight text); opt out anytime in `Manager → Settings` → uncheck `Share anonymized annotations` (also `annotation.utkubilen.de`, private, no AI).
